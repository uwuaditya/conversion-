        <h1>The Intersection of Religious Liberty and State Legislation: Anti-Conversion Laws in India</h1>

                Twelve states in India have adopted laws criminalizing religious conversions under certain
                circumstances. Anti-proselytisation laws form the most common category of laws restricting
                conversion globally - all of India’s state level anti-conversion laws fall under this head.
                5
                The construction of these laws is virtually identical - each of them prohibits conversion when
                taken under conditions of force, fraud or inducement. While their promulgators claim that the
                aim of these acts is to protect the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of conscience, critics take
                the opposite view, claiming that these laws are fueled by Hindu nationalist motives and are
                antagonistic to the interests of religious minorities.
                The Justice Niyogi Committee Report on Christian Missionary Activities published by the
                Government of Madhya Pradesh in 1956 has served as the foundation for state-level
                anti-conversion laws. Note that the origin of these laws have often been shrouded in
                circumstances where a minority religion is deemed the aggressor.
                Political supporters of anti-conversion laws typically include the Bhartiya Jananta Party (BJP),
                the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) -
                collectively the "Sangh Parivar”. Therefore it is difficult to write off the distinctly Hindu nationalist
                pushes for anti-conversion laws. Then BJP President, Rajnath Singh had encouraged states
                that are a BJP stronghold to pass such legislation, in the wake of the enactment of the Himachal
                Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2006.
                6
                It is important to consider the language around these laws - formally known as “Freedom of
                Religion Acts”, the most common line of criticism against them is that they usually have the
                exact opposite effect - placing undue restrictions on conversions and religious freedom.
                Litigation challenging the constitutionality of these laws has primarily focused on their
                constitutionality with respect to Article 25(1) (which allows for religious propagation) of the
                Constitution of India. In response, courts have satisfied the question by laying out the scope of
                the right under Article 25 and holding that the fundamental right does not extend to conversion
                since one should exercise “his right in a manner commensurate with the like freedom of persons
                following the other religions”. In other words, the court has held that recognising the practice of
                conversion as a fundamental right would unfairly infringe upon other religions.
                7
                An angle of these laws that has been left largely unchallenged is the standard employed to
                determine whether the conversion was truly forced. In matters of faith, how can the state
                determine whether a convert has truly accepted the religion, or whether there was an element of
                coercion involved? The definition of ‘inducement’ per the Himachal Pradesh, Orissa and
                Arunachal Pradesh acts is as follows: "Inducement shall include the offer of any gift or
                gratification, either in cash or in kind and shall also include the grant of any benefit, either
                pecuniary or otherwise.” In Yulitha Hyde v The State of Orissa, the Orissa High Court
                
                acknowledged the possible shortcomings of such a standard, including the potential of its wide
                wording to impinge upon legitimate methods of proselytising.
                8 Such a standard appears
                contentious and poorly thought-out.
                The laws also unfairly target conversions happening from Hinduism compared to those
                happening to Hinduism. Proselytism is a key part of the teachings of Islam and Christianity
                which contributes to the disproportionate impact that these communities face as a result of
                these laws. Additionally, charitable acts, which are also central to many of these faiths, could
                also be construed as offences under the legislation. The scope for discriminatory application of
                these laws is immense.
                Scholars have tied the enactment of anti-conversion laws to increased communal violence
                against religious minorities. Attacks on missionaries, and the destruction of places of worship
                are all commonplace in territories where the issue of conversion rears its head.
                9
                These laws ignore that often, the catalyst for conversion is a desire to escape from the clutches
                of the caste system. Those from scheduled castes form the major portion of those seeking to
                convert out of Hinduism. The Ambedkarite project (Ambedkar himself converted to Buddhism,
                citing his desire to not die a Hindu) is also undermined. No doubt these anti-conversion laws
                have, and will continue to unfairly target converts seeking to exercise their fundamental right to
                religious freedom.
